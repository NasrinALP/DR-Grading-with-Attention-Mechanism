# DR-Grading-with-Attention-Mechanism
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with an attention mechanism for automatic Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) grading from retinal fundus images. The attention module helps the model focus on important retinal regions, improving accuracy and interpretability.
